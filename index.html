    <h1>Privacy Policy for PathXplorer</h1>
    <p>Last updated: May 18, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>PathXplorer ("we," "our," or "app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the absence of data collection when you use our mobile application.</p>
    
    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>PathXplorer does not collect, store, process, or share any personal data from users.</strong> The app functions entirely on your device and does not transmit any information to external servers or third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>PathXplorer requires certain device permissions to function properly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location services</strong>: Used exclusively on-device to track your position for mapping features</li>
        <li><strong>Storage access</strong>: Used only to save tracks locally on your device</li>
        <li><strong>Activity recognition</strong>: Used only on-device for step counting features</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for app functionality and no data is transmitted outside your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong>: Used for map displays. When downloading map tiles, standard network requests occur but no personally identifiable information is transmitted.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenWeather</strong>: Used to provide weather information. When requesting weather data, your current location coordinates are sent to OpenWeather's API, but no user account or personal information is shared. Please refer to OpenWeather's privacy policy for more information about how they handle location data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>As we collect no data whatsoever, there are no special provisions needed for children's privacy.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>Any changes to this policy will be posted within the app. As our no-collection practices are fundamental to our app, significant changes are unlikely.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Email: charlesemmanuel1967@gmail.com</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This simplified privacy policy reflects our commitment to zero data collection while providing full transparency about our practices.</p>
